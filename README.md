# LibraryP
A playful, event-driven library management system in Python designed with object-oriented principles.

It features a singleton library, book and availability event systems, and interactive user-author relationships.

This project also includes a child-friendly command-line interface using colorama for colorful and engaging interactions.

🔧 Features:
- Book creation by authors (with optional co-authors)
- Event-based notifications when books are published or become available
- Users can follow authors and reserve books
- Interactive terminal interface (CLI) with fun visuals
- Clean architecture using OOP (Singleton, Observer, Inheritance, etc.)

🏫 For educational purposes or as a base for more advanced library systems!
